Portfolio for the Extremely Hirable Hannah Mancill

This website serves as a digital portfolio for Hannah Mancill, a potential employee. The portfolio includes my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. 

When you click in the navigation links, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When you click on the link to the section about my work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications. My most recent application is larger in size than the others. When you click on the images of the applications, you will be taken to that deployed application. When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, you will be presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.
